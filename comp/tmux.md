## Keyboard Shortcuts

* ^b then c to create a new window
* ^b then n to switch to the next window
* ^b then , then [type something] then ⌤ to rename the current window
* ^b then % to split the current window into panes vertically
* ^b then " to split the current window into panes horizontally
* ^b then ↑ to move to the above pane (works for all four arrows)
* ^b then q to show pane numbers, then (optionally) the number to switch to that pane
* ^b then ⎇↑ to resize the current pane up (works for all four arrows)
* ^b then x to kill the current pane (or window if it only has one pane)
* ^b then [ to enter copy mode, then four arrow keys to move, even past the visible point, which is great for scrolling--I don't use it much for copying/pasting.
* ^b then L to switch between sessions
